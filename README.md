# Assignment
Write a program that, given a number n, returns the absolute difference between n and 21. If n is greater than 21, return double the absolute difference.

## Starter Code in `oddAbsolute.py`

```python
# This first line is provided for you
in_num = input("Enter a number: ")
```

## Desired Output
```
Enter a number: 20
Result: 1
Enter a number: 30
Result: 18
```
## Note: complete the code inside the calculateAbsolute section.  Each line should be indented between the comments in that file.  For example
```
calculateAbsolute():
    all of the
    code you are writing
    should be indented 4 spaces
    in between the comments in that file
```

## Hint
The desired output needs to be printed exactly as described in the assignment, if it is not, the tests will fail.
    
## Test
Run `pytest` in your terminal to check that your tests pass!
